# Lecture Creation Workflow

Create a beautiful, pedagogically excellent Beamer lecture deck.

**This is a collaborative, iterative process. The instructor drives the vision; Claude is a thinking partner.**

---

## CONSTRAINTS (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Read the knowledge base FIRST** — notation registry, narrative arc, applications database
2. Every new symbol MUST be checked against the notation registry
3. Motivation before formalism — no exceptions
4. Worked example within 2 slides of every definition
5. Max 2 colored boxes per slide
6. No `\pause` or overlay commands (check project rules)
7. Transition slides at major conceptual pivots
8. Thread at least 1 running empirical application throughout
9. All citations verified against the bibliography
10. **Work in batches of 5-10 slides** — share for feedback, don't bulk-dump

## WORKFLOW

### Phase 0: Intake & Context
- Read knowledge base and creation guide
- Inventory provided materials (papers, slides, code)
- Read previous lecture's structure and ending
- State pedagogical goal, get user confirmation

### Phase 1: Paper Analysis (When Papers Provided)
- Split into chunks, extract key ideas
- Map paper notation → course notation
- Identify slide-worthy content
- Present summary for approval

### Phase 2: Structure Proposal
- Propose outline (5-Act or 3-Part template)
- List TikZ diagrams and R figures needed
- List new notation to introduce
- **GATE: User approves before Phase 3**

### Phase 3: Draft Slides (Iterative)
- Work in batches of 5-10 slides
- Check notation, apply creation patterns
- Quality checks during drafting

### Phase 4: Figures & Code
- R scripts following conventions
- TikZ diagrams in Beamer source (single source of truth)
- Save RDS for future Quarto integration

### Phase 5: Polish & Compile
- Full 3-pass compilation
- Run Devil's Advocate
- Run Substance Review (if domain reviewer configured)
- Update knowledge base with new notation
